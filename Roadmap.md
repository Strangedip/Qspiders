iii) advantages of bitmasking
-> Interview prob of bit masking

17. Strings (builder & manipulation)
Do Questions from leetcode easy to medium & popularity wise +Interview Q's

18. Time & Space complexiy (Detail ) eg- aux vs total space, static & dynamic memory allocation
{Resource:- CodeforCause channel >> Workshop playlist >> webinar on Time complexity}

19. Recursion & Backtracking
{eg- recursive tree, visualise Q's and stack trace using pen & paper}
i) Merge sort
ii) Quick sort
Do Questions from leetcode easy to medium & popularity wise +Interview Q's
(eg- strings+Recursion prob, backtracking prob)

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

make lots of project using oops concept (eg- book management system, railway reservation systems,etc)

20. Linked List
(cycle detection prob, fast & slow pointers)

21. Stacks & Queue: -
(push efficient stack, pop ef st & queue using 2 stacks)

24. Graphs (all terminology)
(Adjacency list/map implementation

25. Dynamic Programming
(Overlapping subproblems, memoization vs tabulation, top down vs bottom up approach)
 0-1 knapsack prob, wildcard pattern problem, Matrix chain multiplication, egg drop problem
i) first do recursion solution
ii) than recursion dynamic prog solution
iii) than convert it into iterative solution{tabulation form} 
(Its time complexity)
iv) iteration with space optimization

[ Do As many prob as possible ]

[Not give more than 30-40 min per Question]

APPROACH
put 15min >> look for hint(than put 10-15 min) >> editorial(try to catch the concept) >> Upsolve(without copy) >> comeBack after a week (try to solve or repeat cycle)

Eg- if you give 5 hours daily you could solve 10 Qns (30 min per prob) in some Q'n give 45 min if necessary

if you are dedicated it will take 3-4 months 👍
(or if it extends don't worry focus on learning than time) 

After that Regularly daily Practice Questions 🔚
